			<p class='intro__dek'><em>How much progress has American literature really made towards gender equality?</em></p>
		</div>
		<div class='story__text'>
			<p>Shirley Jackson was one of the literary superstars of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Her work is considered classic, but she was also successful in her lifetime. She wrote 17 books, won signifcant awards, and had her work adapted for television, film, and the ballet.</p>

			<p>Jackson was also a woman, wife, and mother. In the 1950s, this came with an obvious downside. When Jackson went into the hospital to deliver her third child, she had the following exchange with the receptionist filling out her form:</p>

			<blockquote class='exchange tk-canela'>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Occupation?”</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“Housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large jackson'><strong>“Writer,” I said.</strong></p>
				<p class='large reception'><strong>“I'll just put down housewife,” she said.</strong></p>
		    </blockquote>

			<p>It certainly seems like gender equality in literary authorship has come a long way in the past seventy years. For one thing: if a woman says she's a writer, I think people have an easier time accepting that she's a <em>goddamned</em> writer.</p>

			<p>But then again, I'm a writer and a woman. And I'm an optimist, so I could be wrong.</p>

			<p>How much progress has American literature actually made towards gender equality in the past 70 years?</p>
			
			<p>To answer this question, I looked at the gender of the authors of books on the New York Times Best-Sellers List over time.</p>

			<p>The list is published weekly and features the 10-15 best-selling fiction books in America at that time, and has been since the 1940s. Making it onto the list is a good indicator of a book’s commercial success &mdash; the list is based off of surveys of booksellers &mdash; but it’s also a marketing boon on its own, as people often tend to discover or purchase books <i>because</i> they've appeared on the list.</p>

			<p>Books by women composed 25-30% of the list in the 1950s. The 1960s and the 1970s were inconsistent. This probably had something to do with the Women’s Liberation movement, which  was in full swing at the time. But the list was also temporarily capped at 10 books a week &mdash; making the annual list of books shorter, and more sensitive to small changes. Female representation on the list 1960-179 got as high as 38% in 1970 and as low 14% in 1975.</p>

			<p>But after the bras had burned and the 10-book limit was lifted, not much had changed: in both 1990 and 1950, 28% of the books on the list were written by women. Lasting change didn’t come until the 1990s, when female writers made steady gains onto the list until 2001. 2001 saw the highest ratio of all time: 50% women, 50% men. After that, the rate dipped and flattened: just beneath the 50% line.</p>

			<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>What happened in the 1990s?</h3>
			<p><i>The Times</i> is famously tight-lipped about how it compiles its best-sellers list, mostly because they don’t want wealthy authors trying to game the system. But, as Danielle Ha Rhoades, VP of Communications, wrote me in an email, “There has been no change in our methodology that would affect the female-to-male author ratio.” You can read the public information on the methodology <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/methodology/">here</a>.</p>

			<p>This means that the change in the ratio likely reflects an actual change in the world.</p>

			<p>Since most of this change occurred in the 1990s, I was curious to see whether the authors in that decade were special. Here, binned by decade, are the top-performing authors on the NYTimes Best-Sellers list, as measured by how many books of theirs made the list in that time period.</p>

			<ul class='notice'>

				<li>The list is getting harder to top. For example: romance novelist Danielle Steel was the top best-seller of the 1990s, with 15 best-selling titles in 10 years. 15 books was the <i>bottom</i> cut-off for the list in the 2000s, but Steel topped it again, with 25 best-selling books.</li>

				<li>There was only one woman on the top-performers list in the 1980s...Steel again, who tied for third with Science Fiction author/Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.</li>

				<li>The top-performers from the 1970s onward were universally authors of <em>genre fiction</em>.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>To learn more, I roughly categorized every book on the list by genre. The result of this research is in the chart below, which I encourage you to explore. As you can see, genre fiction at large enjoyed a heyday through the 1980s and 90s.</p>

			<p>Genre fiction &mdash; like mystery, romance, scifi, and horror &mdash; is fiction that’s written to fit into a specific genre. Many writers do this to capture an existing readership. For example: I’m unlikely to read a novel I haven’t heard of by an author I haven’t heard of. But if it’s a <i>scifi</i> book, I’m much more likely to be down (especially if it’s written by a woman.)</p>

			<p>Genre fiction is often compared to <em>literary fiction</em>. In theory, <em>literary fiction</em> is supposed to refer to work of true literary merit. If that sounds subjective, it's because it is. In practice the term generally refers to books written by people with MFA degrees and/or professorships; books which tend to to be critically acclaimed, realistic, and to not involve things like aliens, magic, detectives or cowboys.</p>

			<p>In the chart above, books that fell into one of the smaller genres -- like historical fiction and domestic fiction -- were labeled "Other." Books that didn’t seem to fall into a genre at all were labeled “Literary/None".</p>

			<p>I also took a look at each of these genres by decade, and tracked the gender ratio for each decade with at least 10 books on the best-sellers list.</p>

			<p>On the one hand, there are the consistently male-dominated genres: fantasy and science fiction, spy and politics fiction, suspense fiction, and adventure fiction. Non-genre fiction and literary fiction still technically counts as male-dominated, although it’s much closer to even than the genres mentioned above.</p>

			<p>Then there are the genres that have flipped. The horror/paranormal genre is now at gender parity, no small thanks to paranormal romance novels. Mystery is the most balanced genre over time, which shouldn't be surprising given the genre's history. The 1920s and 30s are known as the "Golden Age of Detective Fiction," and were dominated by a quartet of female authors known as the Queens of Crime &mdash; Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham.</p>

			<p>Along with almost every other genre, best-selling romance novels were mostly written by men in the 1950s. But the romance novel industry, with specialized publishers, only really developed in the 1960s and the 1970s. And as a genre that is mostly about women, and mostly read by women, it was probably most vulnerable to changing sexual politics. In 1972 the content of the books became a lot more explicit, following the development of the “bodice-ripper” novel. The term comes from the fact that these first, more explicitly-described scenes tended not to be consensual &mdash; because norms fetishizing female chastity persisted even in romance novels. As norms shifted, female writers had a natural advantage writing for mostly female readers about mostly female experiences of love and sex.</p>

		<h3 class='subhed tk-canela'>Why aren't we at parity?</h3>

		<p>As much as I’ve dissected the genres, non-genre fiction dominates the list. There’s evidence that women are at a significant disadvantage in this particular area &mdash; both in marketing and publishing.</p>

		<p>According to the most recent VIDA Count, a non-profit that goes through literary journalism outlets and tallies the gender ratios, in 2015, books by women made up less than 20% of books reviewed by the New York Book Review, 30% by Harpers, 29% by the Atlantic, and 22% by the London Review of Books.</p>

		<p>Men also win more awards than women, at similar rates, and last year there wasn’t a single woman nominated for the National Book Award.</p>

		<p>A lot of this seems to owe to bias in publishing. In 2011, Ruth Franklin at The New Republic decided to do a smaller analysis of mainstream publishing catalogs, and found similarly biased ratios, and the Huffington Post followed this up in 2012 with similar findings.</p>

		<p>Reporters who have written about this have grasped for an explanation beyond just plain sexism. Institutional sexism like this doesn’t boil down to one or two men-in-charge being pig-headed misogynists. As Laura Miller wrote in Salon:</p>

		<blockquote><p><em>Book publishers, like any other business, want to make money, and multiple surveys indicate that women buy and read far more books than men do. [...] If women were only — or even primarily — interested in books by women, the logic of the marketplace would dictate that publishers should release more titles by female authors.</em></p></blockquote>

		<p>Unfortunately our dataset doesn't give us any clues as to what's going on. If the New York Times Best-Sellers list is any indication, Miller's right about the fiction market. The fact that nearly 50% of best-sellers are by women &mdash; even when they're only about a third of the books published, or the books reviewed &mdash; is remarkable. And it probably means there's more demand for female-authored literature than is being supplied or promoted.</p>
